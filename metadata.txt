It supports generating 3D models for use directly in QGIS, as well as exporting to formats like OBJ and CityJSON for further processing and visualisation. This plugin was developed as part of the Innotech â€“ TaskForce Interreg project to support urban planning technology. We encourage users to contact us to contribute to follow-up research.
